PlayCanvas + Typescript Starter project. 

![ScreenShot](/docs/screenshot.png)

See setup.sh for a list of commands that may be useful for setting up the project.

Right now tested in Visual Studio 2015. Make sure to install the latest typescript tools (2.2.2). 

Should work in vscode with minor tweaks.
